# Launching lab in simulation mode

## Enable simulation mode
By default, the simulation mode is on to avoid accidentally connecting to the actual devices. You can
set the environment variable `SIM_MODE_FLAG` to `FALSE` to disable the simulation mode.

```bash
export SIM_MODE_FLAG=FALSE
```

```{note}
As in this tutorial, we will always run the code with the simulation mode on.

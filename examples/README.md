# Alab Example
The folder `alab_example` contains a Python package that includes a copy of device and task definitions used in 
A-Lab. 

Once the package is installed and the alabos is running, you can submit the experiment to the server with 
the script in `submission_scripy.ipynb`, where an experiment with 16 sampels is defined and submitted to the alabos server.
